### **Part 1: Project Phase 1 Specification and Prototype Development (Group Task)**

**Objective:** To solidify the requirements for the initial phase of your group project and create a functional user interface prototype.

**Background:** Building upon the initial concept discussed in class (Activity 2), your group will now define the scope for Phase 1 in detail and translate that into a tangible user interface prototype using Gradio.

**Tasks:**

1.  **Define Detailed Specifications for Phase 1:**
    *   Document the specific features and functionalities planned for the *first iteration* of your project.
    *   Include:
        *   Key user interactions and workflows.
        *   Input requirements and expected outputs.
        *   Descriptions of the user interface (UI) elements needed (e.g., dropdowns, text boxes, buttons, output areas).
        *   (Optional but recommended) Simple user stories (e.g., "As a user, I want to select X so that I can achieve Y").
    *   This specification should be clear enough for someone outside your group to understand what Phase 1 aims to achieve.

2.  **Outline General Specifications for Phases 2 and 3:**
    *   Briefly describe the high-level goals and anticipated features for the *subsequent phases* of your project.
    *   Consider potential advancements, new functionalities, or integration of more complex backend logic (e.g., actual ML models, APIs) that are *out of scope* for Phase 1.
    *   This provides a roadmap for future development.

3.  **Develop an Interactive Gradio Prototype for Phase 1:**
    *   Create a functional Gradio application (`gr.Blocks` recommended) that implements the user interface defined in your Phase 1 specifications.
    *   **Focus:** Demonstrate the core UI flow and user interactions.
    *   **Functionality:** Use mock data or simple logic functions (similar to the class demo) to simulate responses. *No complex backend or real ML model integration is required for this prototype.*
    *   The prototype should visually represent the user experience planned for Phase 1.

**Deliverable & Presentation:**

*   **Prepare a concise group presentation** (e.g., 5-7 minutes, using slides).
*   **Content:**
    *   Brief project overview.
    *   Summary of Phase 1 detailed specifications.
    *   Overview of Phase 2 & 3 general specifications.
    *   A live demo or clear screenshots/walkthrough of your Gradio prototype.
*   **Note:** One group will be randomly selected to present their work to the class. All groups should be prepared. Submit presentation slides and a link to your specification document/code repository.

### **Part 2: Gradio Advanced Features Exploration (Group Task)**

**Objective:** To identify advanced Gradio capabilities that could enhance your project in future phases.

**Task:**

1.  **Explore Advanced Gradio Functionality:**
    *   Visit the [Gradio Documentation](https://www.gradio.app/docs/gradio) and potentially the [Gradio Playground](https://www.gradio.app/playground).
    *   Investigate features beyond basic input/output components, such as:
        *   State Management (`gr.State`) for multi-turn interactions.
        *   Layout options (`gr.Row`, `gr.Column`, `gr.Tab`, `gr.Accordion`).
        *   Dynamic UI updates (`gr.update`).
        *   Theming and custom CSS/JS.
        *   Handling different data types (images, audio, files).
        *   (If applicable) Integration patterns for ML models.
2.  **Analyze Relevance to Your Project:**
    *   Discuss within your group which of these advanced features could be most valuable for enhancing your *specific* project in Phases 2 or 3.

**Deliverable:**

*   **Submit a brief group report** (e.g., 1-2 pages).
*   **Content:**
    *   List and briefly explain 3-5 advanced Gradio features your group found most interesting or potentially useful.
    *   For each feature, justify *why* and *how* it could be applied to improve or extend your project beyond the Phase 1 prototype.

### **Part 3: Understanding Prompting Techniques (Group Task)**

**Objective:** To understand fundamental techniques for interacting effectively with Large Language Models (LLMs), which may be relevant for future project phases involving natural language processing.

**Task:**

1.  **Study Core Prompting Techniques:**
    *   Review the concepts and examples provided at the [Prompting Guide - Techniques Section](https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques), focusing specifically on:
        *   **Zero-Shot Prompting:** Asking the model to perform a task without any prior examples.
        *   **Few-Shot Prompting:** Providing the model with a small number of examples within the prompt to guide its response.
        *   **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting:** Encouraging the model to break down its reasoning process step-by-step before giving a final answer.
2.  **Discuss and Compare:**
    *   Analyze the strengths, weaknesses, and typical use cases for each technique.
    *   Consider when one technique might be preferred over another.

**Deliverable:**

*   **Submit a group summary report** (e.g., 1 page).
*   **Content:**
    *   Provide a concise definition and explanation of Zero-shot, Few-shot, and Chain-of-Thought prompting.
    *   Compare their effectiveness and outline potential scenarios within AI applications (not necessarily just your own project) where each might be most applicable.

### **Part 4: Machine Learning Evolution - Reading and Analysis (Group Task)**

**Objective:** To understand the historical context and comparative strengths of different machine learning paradigms by analyzing a relevant academic paper.

**Task:**

1.  **Read Assigned Paper:**
    *   Carefully read the paper: Gharaibeh, R.; Al-Badarneh, A.; Al-Naami, B.; Al-Rababah, H. From Classical Machine Learning to Deep Neural Networks: A Simplified Scientometric Review. *Appl. Sci.* **2021**, *11*, 5541.
    *   Access via: [Local Link](./paper-week-04.pdf) or [MDPI Website](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/11/12/5541)

2.  **Group Discussion and Analysis:** Focus your discussion on the following key aspects presented in the paper:
    *   The characteristics and evolution of "classical" machine learning algorithms (e.g., Decision Trees, SVM, Random Forests).
    *   The rise and defining features of Deep Learning / Deep Neural Networks.
    *   The comparative strengths, limitations, and typical application domains of classical ML versus Deep Learning methods as outlined or implied by the review.
    *   Key trends or milestones identified in the paper's scientometric analysis.

*   **Content:**
    *   Summarize the main points discussed regarding the evolution from classical ML to Deep Learning.
    *   Highlight the key differences in capabilities and use cases between these two paradigms as discussed in the paper.
    *   Briefly mention any significant trends observed in the research landscape according to the paper's review.
